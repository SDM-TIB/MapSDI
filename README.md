# MapSDI

Mapping based Semantic Data Integration workflow allows for the semantic enrichment of large sized, heterogeneous, potentially low quality data efficiently.

To run the workflow python3 and an RDFizer e.g. https://github.com/SDM-TIB/TIB-RDFizer or https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java are required to be installed.

To run the workflow:
python3 mappingParser.py --path-to-mappings  --path-to-output
